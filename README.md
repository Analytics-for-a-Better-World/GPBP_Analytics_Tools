# Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform

For critical planning and budgeting 

This repository consists of a collection of Python Notebooks to preprocess Geospatial Data and perform descriptive and prescriptive analytics on them to feed in to the Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform.

## Style Guide for Python Scripts
This repository uses the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id14) for improving readability of the code and to maintain consistency. 

Some of the key guidelines are outlined below. For details visit [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id14) 
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs. Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively.
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.
- Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line. Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).
- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

## Connecting GitHub with Google Colaboratory

[Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com) is designed to integrate cleanly with GitHub, allowing both loading notebooks from github and saving notebooks to github. 

Colab can load public github notebooks directly, with no required authorization step. For example, consider the notebook at this address: https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb. The direct colab link to this notebook is: https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb. To generate such links in one click, you can use the [Open in Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) Chrome extension.


## About the Team
The design, development and deployment of the Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform is led by teams at [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) and [Analytics for a Better World](https://analyticsbw.org) in collaboration with governmental, non-governmental organisations, startups and researchers from around the globe.
