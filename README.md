# Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform

For critical planning and budgeting 

This repository consists of a collection of Python Notebooks to preprocess Geospatial Data and perform descriptive and prescriptive analytics on them to feed in to the Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform.

## Style Guide 
This repository uses the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id14) for improving readability of the code and to maintain consistency. 

Some of the key guidelines are outlined below. For details visit [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id14) 
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs. Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively.
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.
- Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line. Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).
- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
