## Integrative Assessment of Climate Risks and Criticality of Infrastructure in Serbia Using Advanced Data Analysis

### Background

This thesis proposes an integrative approach to assess the vulnerability and criticality of key infrastructures in Serbia, specifically hospitals and road networks, in the context of climate change. Employing a comprehensive data-driven methodology, the study aims to analyze the impact of projected climate scenarios on these infrastructures, while simultaneously evaluating their importance in relation to the demographic and socio-economic fabric of the country. Serbia's strategic position and diverse climatic conditions make its infrastructure particularly susceptible to climate-induced risks. 

This research seeks to address two main objectives:
- To map and assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructures to future climate scenarios, focusing on variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind.
- To determine the criticality of these infrastructures, considering their role and importance in serving various demographic groups across the country.

### Methodology

- Data Collection and Integration - Utilize climate data from the European Space Agency for future climate scenarios and gather infrastructure data on hospitals and roads from OpenStreetMap.
- Incorporate demographic and high-resolution population data from WorldPop and Meta High Resolution Population Estimates.
- Perform a detailed vulnerability analysis of the infrastructures against projected climate changes.
- Analyze the demographic data to understand the dependency of various population segments on these infrastructures.
- Integrate these analyses to assess the compounded risks and criticalities.

#### Outputs
- Develop comprehensive risk profiles for each infrastructure type.
- Create visual representations (maps, charts) to depict areas of high risk and criticality.
Impact

This research is poised to provide a nuanced understanding of how climate change intersects with infrastructure utility and dependency. The findings are expected to be crucial for policymakers and planners in prioritizing interventions and resources. Furthermore, the study aims to contribute significantly to the academic discourse on climate resilience and infrastructure planning. The proposed thesis sets out to deliver an in-depth, data-centric analysis of Serbia's infrastructure resilience to climate change. By focusing on the dual aspects of vulnerability and criticality, the study endeavors to provide a holistic view of the challenges and needs in infrastructure planning and climate adaptation strategies in Serbia.
