        "### This Jupyter notebook aims to evaluate the percentage of the population with access to hospitals and clinics in Timor-Leste, utilizing Python and geospatial analysis. It combines geospatial data from various sources, such as GADM, Facebook population data, and OpenStreetMap, to determine healthcare access within specific administrative regions. The notebook involves spatial visualization, spatial joins, and isochrone analysis to estimate the catchment areas of healthcare facilities. Finally, it calculates the percentage of the population with healthcare access and visualizes the results on an interactive map using Folium.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Facebook Population Data: Facebook population data for Timor-Leste in 2020 is retrieved and processed, creating a geospatial dataset of population distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Healthcare Facility Data: Healthcare facility data, including hospitals and clinics, is collected from OpenStreetMap using Overpass API. The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.\n",

        "* Catchment Area Analysis: Isochrone analysis is conducted to estimate the catchment areas of healthcare facilities. This analysis helps determine which population groups have access to healthcare services from each facility.\n",

        "### GADM, which stands for \"Global Administrative Areas,\" is a valuable resource in the field of geospatial analysis and cartography. GADM provides comprehensive and up-to-date geographical data on administrative boundaries for countries worldwide. Here are some key points to note about GADM data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Administrative Boundary Data:** GADM offers geospatial data representing administrative divisions within countries. This includes boundaries for countries, states, provinces, districts, municipalities, and other administrative units. Users can access boundary data at various administrative levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Global Coverage:** GADM covers nearly every country on Earth, making it a truly global resource. This extensive coverage is invaluable for researchers, analysts, and cartographers working with geospatial information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Accurate and Detailed:** GADM data is known for its accuracy and detail. It is curated and maintained to provide the most up-to-date and reliable information on administrative boundaries. This level of precision is essential for various applications, including geographic analysis and map creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Open Access:** GADM data is typically available as open data, meaning it can be freely accessed, downloaded, and used by the public. This open access policy encourages widespread use and collaboration in the geospatial community.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Diverse Use Cases:** GADM data finds applications in a wide range of fields, including urban planning, epidemiology, environmental science, and social sciences. It supports research, decision-making, and policy development by providing a foundation for spatial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Spatial Analysis:** Researchers and analysts often use GADM data for tasks such as spatial joins, geospatial modeling, demographic analysis, and accessibility assessments. It forms the basis for answering questions related to administrative boundaries and geographic distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Map Visualization:** Cartographers use GADM data to create maps at various scales and levels of detail. These maps are instrumental in illustrating administrative divisions, electoral boundaries, and other geographic features.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Consistent Format:** GADM data is typically available in standard geospatial file formats such as Shapefiles or GeoJSON, making it compatible with a wide range of Geographic Information System (GIS) software and tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, GADM data is a valuable resource for accessing high-quality, up-to-date geographical information on administrative boundaries worldwide. Its open access nature and precision make it an essential asset for professionals and researchers working in the field of geospatial analysis and mapping."

Key highlights of these population density maps include:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Public Availability:** These population density maps are publicly accessible and cover over 160 countries and territories worldwide. They can be downloaded from platforms such as Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Step 2: Satellite Imagery Analysis:** Computer algorithms are trained to analyze satellite imagery. The presence of buildings and structures is used as an indicator of human population.\n",
