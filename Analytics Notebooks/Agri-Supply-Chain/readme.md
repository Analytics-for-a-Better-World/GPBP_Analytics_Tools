## Optimizing Tomato Supply Chain in Andhra Pradesh, India: A Data-Driven Approach to Reducing Food Loss, Mitigating Climate Impact, and Enhancing Food Security

### Background

The agricultural sector in India, particularly for perishable commodities like tomatoes, faces significant challenges in supply chain management, leading to substantial food loss and environmental impact. According to 2022 data, India experienced a loss of 6-15% in fruits and 5-12% in vegetables, including tomatoes, primarily due to inadequate storage and transportation infrastructure. These inefficiencies not only contribute to economic losses, estimated at over â‚¹1,52,000 crores, but also exacerbate climate change through unnecessary carbon emissions and resource wastage. The project aims to address these challenges by optimizing the tomato supply chain in [Selected State], leveraging openly available data and integrating climate considerations into the supply chain management.

### Project Objectives

- Reduce Food Loss and Waste: The project aims to significantly reduce tomato post-harvest losses by optimising the supply chain, thereby contributing to farmers' and consumers' food security and economic stability.
Climate Change Mitigation: By enhancing supply chain efficiency, the project will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with food wastage and inefficient logistics, thus contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
- Data Utilization and Analysis: The project will utilize data from various sources:
1. Meta Segment Anything Model: To identify tomato farms and potential areas for infrastructure development.
2. ESRI LULC Data: This is used to assess land use and identify optimal locations for storage and processing facilities.
3. Data.gov.in: For infrastructure data on warehouses, markets, and crop productivity statistics.
4. OpenStreetMap: To analyze the road network for efficient transportation routes.
5. Price Tracking: Price tracking is integral to understanding market dynamics and optimizing supply chain decisions accordingly.
- Integration with Government Initiatives: The project will align with existing government initiatives such as the National Mission on Food Processing, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, National Agriculture Market (eNAM), and PM Kisan Sampada Yojana. This will ensure synergy with national efforts to improve food processing, market access, and agricultural insurance.
- Technology Adoption and Innovation: Emphasizing the need for technological advancement in the supply chain, from cold storage solutions to logistics optimization, the project will explore innovative approaches to tackle existing challenges.
- Enhancing Food Safety and Quality Standards: Aligning with FSSAI's efforts, the project will also focus on improving food safety and quality throughout the supply chain, ensuring that consumers receive high-quality produce.

### Expected Outcomes

The project aims to deliver a comprehensive supply chain optimization model for the tomato crop in Andhra Pradesh, India. This model will reduce food loss, mitigate climate impact, enhance overall supply chain efficiency, contribute to economic stability, and support sustainable agricultural practices. The research will provide actionable insights for policymakers, farmers, and businesses, paving the way for India's more sustainable and resilient food system.
